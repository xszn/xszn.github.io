Home Assistant is free and open-source software used to enable centralized home automation. It is a smart home controller that serves both as a smart home hub (sometimes called a "smart gateway") and an integration platform designed for interoperability, allowing users to have a single point of control and enable automating different smart home devices from a central location regardless of manufacturer or brand. The software emphasizes local control and privacy and is designed to be independent of any specific Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem without having to rely on cloud services.[2][3][4][5] Its customizable user interface can be accessed through any web-browser or by using its mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as different options to also use voice commands via a supported virtual assistant, such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Home Assistant's own "Assist" (a built-in local voice assistant pipeline) using natural language.[6][7][8]

将本地控制和隐私放在首位。它既是智能家居控制器，又可作为智能家居中心（有时也称为“智能网关”）和集成平台，旨在实现互操作性，使用户能够通过单一控制点从中央位置自动化控制不同的智能家居设备，而无需考虑制造商或品牌。 -->
